        <p id="info">As far as we know, the world has a little under 10,000 species of reptiles.
            And about a third of them (perhaps as many as 3,600 species) are snakes.
            This incredible diversity is a testament to their evolutionary success. <br><br>
            Over a hundred million years or so,
            snakes have adapted to nearly every climate and ecosystem on earth.
            As diverse as they are, all snakes share a common body plan, with a long,
            legless trunk and a short tail (you can tell trunk from tail by the skeleton:
            the trunk is the part with the ribs). They also share a common lifestyle –
            every snake, everywhere on earth, is a predator. <br>
            Snakes live in every environment imaginable.</p>
